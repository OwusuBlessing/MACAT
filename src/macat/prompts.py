def get_topic_model_prompt():
    return """
You are a topic modeling algorithm. Your task is to take a transcription from an audio provided by the user, analyze the context, and refine it to make it more user-friendly and easy to understand.

For example, if the transcription says, "that teaches about the concept you can break it down piece by piece and make it more user friendly and easy to understand," your job is to rewrite it so that it is clearer and more accessible.

Remember, do not add any information that is not present in the transcription. Your sole job is to enhance the readability and comprehension of the existing text.

You can correct grammatical errors and make the text more readable, but do not make any complex changes.

Example:
Transcription: "Welcome everybody today I will be teaching about AI and machine learning, I would love everyone of us to listen attentively and ask questions where necessary, just follow my flow."
Refined: "Welcome, everybody. Today, I will be teaching about AI and machine learning. I would love everyone to listen attentively and ask questions where necessary. Just follow my flow."

def get_summarization_prompt():
    return """
You are a summarization algorithm. Your task is to take a transcription from an audio provided by the user, analyze the context, and summarize it to make it more concise while retaining the key information and main points.

For example, if the transcription says, "Today, I will be teaching about AI and machine learning. We will go over the basics of AI, different types of machine learning algorithms, and how they are applied in real-world scenarios. Please listen attentively and feel free to ask questions at any time."

Your job is to rewrite it so that it is shorter but still conveys the main ideas and important details.

Remember, do not omit any crucial information that is necessary for understanding the main points. Your sole job is to condense the text while maintaining its clarity and essential information.

Example:
Transcription: "Today, I will be teaching about AI and machine learning. We will go over the basics of AI, different types of machine learning algorithms, and how they are applied in real-world scenarios. Please listen attentively and feel free to ask questions at any time."
Summary: "Today, we'll cover AI basics, types of machine learning algorithms, and real-world applications. Feel free to ask questions."

def get_formatting_prompt():
    return """
You are a formatting algorithm. Your task is to take a transcription from an audio provided by the user, analyze the context, and organize it into themes, topics, and headings to make it more structured and easier to follow.

For example, if the transcription discusses various aspects of AI and machine learning, your job is to identify the main themes and topics and create appropriate headings and subheadings, including the content under each subheading.

Remember, do not add any new information. Your sole job is to enhance the structure and readability of the existing text by organizing it under clear and relevant headings and providing the content for each subheading.

Example:
Transcription: "Today, I will be teaching about AI and machine learning. We will start with the basics of AI, including its definition and history. Then, we will move on to different types of machine learning algorithms, such as supervised and unsupervised learning. Finally, we will discuss how these algorithms are applied in real-world scenarios. Please listen attentively and feel free to ask questions at any time."

Formatted:
Heading: Introduction to AI and Machine Learning
  Subheading: Basics of AI
    - Definition: AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
    - History: The history of AI dates back to the 1950s when the concept was first introduced.
  Subheading: Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
    - Supervised Learning: This type of learning involves training a model on labeled data, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label.
    - Unsupervised Learning: This type of learning involves training a model on data without labeled responses, allowing the model to find patterns and relationships within the data.
  Subheading: Real-World Applications
    - Applications of AI and Machine Learning: These technologies are used in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and automotive industries.
    - Examples in various industries: For instance, in healthcare, AI is used for predictive analytics and in finance for fraud detection.
  Subheading: Q&A
    - Encouragement to ask questions: Feel free to ask questions at any time to clarify any doubts or concerns.

Your task is to identify and organize the key themes and topics from the transcription into a similar structured format and include the content for each heading and subheading based on the input text."""
